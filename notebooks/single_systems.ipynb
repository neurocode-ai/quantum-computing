    "Suppose that we have a *system* that stores information. And let's assume that this system can be in one of a finite number of *classical states* at each instant. The simplest example which is at the foundation of information theory, is that of a *bit*, which is a system of classical states 0 and 1.\n",

By measuring a system, we mean that we look at the system and unambigiously recognize the classical state it is in. Intuitively, we can never \"see\" a system in a probabilistic state; a measurement yields exactly one of the allowed classical states.\n"
