Such situations arise naturally in the context of information processing, both classical and quantum. Large information-carrying systems are often most easily constructed using collections of smaller systems, such as bits or qubits.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will start at a very basic level, with classical states of multiple systems. For simplicity, we will begin by disussing just two systems, and then generalize to more than two systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be precise, let us suppose that $X$ is a system whose classical state set is $\\Sigma$, and $Y$ is a second system having classical state set $\\Gamma$. As in the previous notebook, because we have reffered to these sets as *classical state sets*, our assumption is that $\\Sigma$ and $\\Gamma$ are both finite and nonempty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's imagine that the two systems, $X$ and $Y$, are placed side-by-side, with $X$ on the left and $Y$ on the right. If we so choose, we can view these two systems as if they form a single system, which we can denote by $(X, Y)$ or $XY$ depending on our preference. \n",
    "\n",
    "A natural question to ask about this compound system $(X, Y)$ is: \"What are its classical states?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that the set of classical states of $(X, Y)$ is the *Cartesian product* of $\\Sigma$ and $\\Gamma$, which is the set defined as\n",
    "$$\\Sigma \\times \\Gamma = \\{(a, b): a\\in\\Sigma \\text{   and   } b\\in\\Gamma\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cartesian product is precisely the mathematical notion that captures the idea of viewing an element of one set and an element of a second set together, as if they form a single element of a single set.\n",

    "It is often convenient to write a classical state $(a_1, ..., a_n)$ as a *string* $a_1\\dots a_n$ for the sake of brevity. Indeed, the notation of a string, is formalized in mathematical terms through Cartesian products. The term *alphabet* is commonly used to refer to sets of symbols used to form strings, but the mathematical definition of an alphabet is precisely the same as the definition of a classical state set: it is a finite and nonempty set.\n",

    "Recall form the previous notebook that a *probabilistic state* associates a probability with each classical state of a system. Thus, a probabilistic state of multiple systems - viewed collectively as if they form a single system - associates a probability with each element of the Cartiesian product of the classical state sets of the individual systems.\n",

    "For example, suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are both bits, so that their corresponding classical state sets are $\\Sigma=\\{0, 1\\}$ and $\\Gamma = \\{0, 1\\}$, respectively. Here is a valid probabilistic state of the pair $(X, Y)$:\n",
