# Quantum information and computing

## Disposition of repository

The core educational material is to be found under the notebooks/ directory. 
Here you can follow teaching material similar to that which Qiskit provides. 
Classical information and its properties will be compared to quantum information such that the
reader can achieve an intuitive understanding of probabilistics and geometrical properties of 
quantum states. Furthermore, some notebooks provide an in depth dive into quantum algorithms 
that are widely used in the field.
